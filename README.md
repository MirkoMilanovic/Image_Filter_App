# Image_Filter_App
This Python app does a search of professional photographs on the selected location, collects metadata, stores the result in a "cache memory" of the program. 
Images can be filtered by keywords or date of creation, previewed (one or all by thumbnails), opened with Windows Explorer or Photoshop.
